# Secret Friend

## About

The secret friend project is based on drawing several friends that have been added by the user, it will not add empty fields, or even reset or draw without the appropriate validations having been carried out.

Note that it is very important that you initially have 4 friends registered, if you have registered even numbers the program will not run the game, any number less than 4 or odd will be blocked from carrying out the draw.
